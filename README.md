# Background
When we have a lot of people working in an office it can get dirty quite quickly if you're not careful.
However, cleaning staff are expensive. To save money on cleaning staff the best solution was deemed to be the creation of an automatic cleaning robot that cleans the office at night.
This is a prototype of this robot which is created in Test Drivent Development (TDD).
